# A learning experience of C#

Using the premade modules of C#, a program was created to allow for interfacing with a database through a simple gui. The gui includes input and edit forms. The structure allows details (ID, price, year and name) of a car to be stored in a database. The databsae is automatically created through the use of C# local database auto creator. The places to focus are in the "Controllers" folder, as well as the "Models" folder, as this is where all the action takes place.
